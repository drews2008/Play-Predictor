  <!-- 
    In a React app, you generally don't include React scripts manually.
    The bundler (e.g., Vite, Webpack) injects your built JS bundle here.
    
    So no need for any Firebase scripts here unless you want to load from CDN
    — but better to import via npm in your React code.
  -->

  <!-- Example: Your built script will be injected here by your bundler -->
  <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
